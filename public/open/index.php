     <h2> About Us</h2>
     <p> 
          Hi! We’re KCLSU (King’s College London Students’ Union). Every student at King's is automatically a member of KCLSU.   
          Together with our members, we are a union of students where individuals connect, have fun, build communities, share 
          experiences, and make change.  We're here to make sure every King's student has the best student experience possible. 
          We're run by students, for students. Our decisions, policies and what we do are decided by our 30,000 student members 
          (that's you!). You elect the Student Officers, Union Development members and Student Reps you want representing you. 
          As a democratic charity and membership organization, students lead us at every level to achieve our priorities. If 
          you want to get more information you can come visit us at our office in Bush House. You can see the location below.
